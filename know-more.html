            <p>
                Until recently, you might not have paid much attention to the waste your organization produces. Many organizations are content simply to establish a system for removing trash. Increasingly, greater attention is being paid to waste management, and pro-active
                organizations are seeing the benefits of establishing a waste reduction program.
                <ul>
                    <li><em><b>Save Money -</b> </em>Increasing recycling can cut your disposal costs and improve your bottom line.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Knowledge is power - </em></b> By understanding the amount and types of wastes your organization produces, you’re better positioned to find ways to reduce hauling costs and negotiate for waste and recycling services that actually
                        fit your needs.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Streamline reporting and information sharing - </em></b>Tracking your waste management activities in one platform and using a standard set of metrics, makes it easier to share and report information with stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Enhance sustainability - </em></b>Managing waste, water, and energy more efficiently are core components of sustainability. Improving your organization’s sustainability can boost your corporate image, attract quality tenants
                        to your properties and positively engage employees.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions -</em></b>Waste prevention and recycling offer significant potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Conserve resources - </em></b>Reuse and recycling conserves natural resources including trees, metals and water.</li>

                Materials and wastes offer an often overlooked opportunity to improve an organization’s sustainability, prevent greenhouse gas emissions and reduce costs. The first step is tracking the amount of wastes your organization generates, for as the old adage
                goes, “you can’t manage what you don’t measure.” Tracking your waste and recycling provides the key foundation for a successful waste reduction program.

                Getting others involved and following an action plan helps ensure the success of your waste reduction program
                <h2>Team Up</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><em><b>Leverage an existing team.</b> </em>Consider adding a focus on waste reduction to your organization's existing green team. This may mean bringing in additional team members with a focus on waste and recycling.</li>
                    <li><b><em>Create a new team. </em></b> If your organization doesn't have a green team, consider creating a group responsible for planning, designing and implementing waste reduction activities. Some tips for pulling together you team
                        include:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get support from management.</li>
                        <li>Recruit representatives from different areas of your organization. A broad-based team will offer a variety of perspectives, creative problems-solving techniques and likely identify more opportunities for improvement.</li>
                        <li>Relate the size of your team to the size of your organization and gather representatives from as many departments, tenants or functions as possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                As the team comes together, it is important to identify its responsibilities, which may include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Working with your organization's management to set short and long-term waste reduction goals.</li>
                    <li>Gathering and analyzing information related to the design and implementation of your planned activities.</li>
                    <li>Securing management participation in endorsing program goals and implementation, communicating the importance of reducing waste within the organization, guiding and sustaining the program and encouraging and rewarding employee commitment
                        and participation in the effort.</li>
                    <li>Promoting the program to other employees and educating them on ways to participate.</li>
                    <li>Offering employee incentives to reduce wastes.</li>
                    <li>Engaging employee to seek suggestions and create recognition and awards programs.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring progress.</li>
                    <li>Reporting the status of planned activities to management.</li>
                    <li>Reporting the organization's waste reduction efforts to all employees. </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Set Goals</h2>
                Having clear measurable goals gives teams a shared understanding of what they're working to accomplish and how they're progressing. Look at your tracking data to establish a benchmark and inform your goal setting. Look at your tracking data to establish
                a benchmark and inform your goal setting. Setting goals helps you prioritize activities for preventing waste and expanding recycling programs. Then track progress towards the goals using your benchmark.

                <h2>Waste Prevention</h2>
                <br> The most effective way to reduce your organization’s waste is to generate less in the first place. Waste prevention offers the greatest environmental benefits and cost savings.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reduce:</b> Organizations can modify their current practices to reduce the amounts of waste generated by changing the design, manufacture, purchase, or use of materials or products. For example, your organization could encourage
                        employees to only print what they need and ensure that printer settings are defaulted to print double sided to save paper.</li>
                    <li><b>Reuse: </b>Reuse of products and packaging prolongs the useful life of these materials, thus delaying final disposal or recycling. Reuse is the repair, refurbishing, washing, or just simple recovery of worn or used products, appliances,
                        furniture and building materials. For example, by encouraging occupants to use reusable coffee mugs rather than single-use, disposable cups, you don’t have to manage the disposal of a bunch of coffee cups.</li>
                    <li><b>Donate: </b>Organizations can donate products or materials to others who need and can use the items. For example, restaurants, hotels and cafeterias promptly distribute perishable and prepared foods to hungry people in their communities.
                        Many local food banks will pick up food donations free of charge, saving you storage and disposal costs.</li>
                </ul>
